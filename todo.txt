- allow multiple @Export and @Observe attributes on the same element
- allow multiple stylesheets on a single component
- allow @Component to configure how the shadow dom is initialized
- component inheritance

- Investigate supporting https://github.com/lume/element-behaviors as a way of getting Angular's directive feature back in some form

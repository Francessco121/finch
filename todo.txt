critical:
- document component lifecycle in docs/
- update readme docs to better represent current goals and show current annotations

nice to haves:
- component inheritance
- angular's @HostBinding and @HostListener annotations? (probably out of scope of the project)
- investigate supporting https://github.com/lume/element-behaviors as a way of getting Angular's directive feature back in some form
  - requires MutationObservers on each shadow root
  - behavior lifecycle init can run on the initial parent render microtask and whenever after first render
- consider making contexts compatible with the context proposal https://github.com/webcomponents-cg/community-protocols/blob/main/proposals/context.md
  - allows us to get a stream for parent data, kinda cool
- subscribing to contexts

maintenance:
- make better use of package:code_builder
  - use builders correctly
  - build expressions instead of string buffers and use References with a prefixing allocator to let code_builder handle
    import as prefixes for us (we can remove the custom code we have now for it)
